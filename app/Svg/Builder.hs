Description: Helpers for enabling graph interactitivy.

This module takes the raw data parsed from the SVG files and computes
prerequisite relationships based on the geometry.

This is currently done after the data is first inserted, when the new
SVG is generated. This work should really be done immediately after
parsing, before anything is inserted into the database.
