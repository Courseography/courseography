Description: Helpers for interacting with the graph database. Incomplete.

This module is responsible for inserting values associated with the graphs
into the database. These functions are just helpers for the main function
in "Svg.Parser", though it is possible to put all of the data retrieval code in
here as well at some point in the future.
