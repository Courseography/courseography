One of our main goals for Courseography is to keep it a student-driven project. This means that if you want to get involved, you can! The best way to get started is by shooting us an email, but you should also feel free to check out all of the source code on Github and the accompanying Projects page.

If you're coming from outside of the Department of Computer Science, we'd love to hear from you! We welcome help on making new graphs, understanding department- or program-specific policies, pointing out bugs or incorrect information, and general thoughts on the design of our tools. You don't need to be a programmer to get involved.

We can be reached at courseography@cs.toronto.edu, and look forward to hearing from you!
