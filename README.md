Courseography [![Slack][slackin-badge]][slackin]
=============

Here at the University of Toronto, we have hundreds of courses to choose from, and it can be hard to navigate prerequisite chains, program requirements, and term-by-term offerings all at once. That's where Courseography comes in: by presenting course and scheduling information in a set of graphical interactive tools, we make it easier to choose the right courses for your academic career. Whether it's making sure you'll satisfy all the prerequities for that 4th year course you really want to take, or fitting together fragments of your schedule for next term, we hope Courseography makes your life easier!

Courseography was envisioned in late 2013 by [David Liu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~liudavid/), then a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science. However, it wasn't until he recruited [Ian Stewart-Binks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~iansb/) to the project that things really got rolling. Though the past year has really seen our tools take off within the CS student body, there's still a long way for us to go. Check out our Projects page to find out more about our plans for expanding to new departments, faculties, and campuses, and adding new services like POSt checking and importing/exporting data.
